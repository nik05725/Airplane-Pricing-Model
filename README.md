This project presents a data-driven Airplane Pricing Model built using Python. It aims to predict the price of an aircraft based on various technical and performance parameters, leveraging machine learning techniques for better pricing accuracy and insights.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Analyze and understand factors affecting airplane prices

Build a machine learning model to predict airplane prices

Evaluate model performance using key metrics

Provide actionable insights for aviation industry stakeholders

ðŸ“‚ Contents
Untitled5.ipynb â€“ Jupyter Notebook with all data processing, modeling, and visualizations

README.md â€“ Overview of the project (youâ€™re here!)

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn â€“ for preprocessing and machine learning modeling

Jupyter Notebook â€“ for development and visualization

ðŸ“Š Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis of airplane features

Model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluation using metrics like RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Open Untitled5.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the notebook step-by-step to see data processing and model results.

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Insights
Engine type, year of manufacture, and maximum range significantly impact pricing.

Ensemble models outperform linear models in pricing accuracy.

ðŸ§  Future Improvements
Include real-time data scraping from aircraft listing websites.

Add more features such as avionics systems, maintenance logs, etc.

Deploy model using a Flask or Streamlit web interface.
